## Assignment 1 

I worked on the lines of the Chisquare distribution done in lab session during class for other distributions. 
I worked on this part of th homework by myself. I later discussed the distributions with Priyanshi and Sunny to know the different types of distribution they did for the assignment (one of their choice). 
I downloaded seaborn and used it to plot my graphs. 

Extra credit - 
I used the docstring for norm.fit and pdf to understand the function and the syntax for it. 

## Assignment 2 

I worked with Sunny to formulate the hypothesis for the citibike data.
We chose to see the seasonal variation in citibike trip duration. 
I tried using the file download code from the example given Dr. Bianco but was unable to run the code, so I downloaded the required files locally and formulated the hypothesis and the plot for the dataset. 

I used the '201501' ,'201502' , '201507'  and '201508' datasets for the assignment.

## Assignment 3

I worked with Achilles in the class to get the z-test value and we were able to get it in class itself. 
The value was verified with Dr.Bianco and she helped us understand the relevance of the value to reject the null hypothesis. 
Later I just formulated the code and the write based on what I understood.
