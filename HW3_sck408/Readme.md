## Assignment 1 

I worked on the lines of the Chisquare distribution done in lab session during class. 
I downloaded seaborn and used it to plot my graphs. 

Extra credit - 
I used the docstring for norm.fit and pdf to understand the function and the syntax for it. 

## Assignment 3

I worked with Achilles in the class to get the z-test value and we were able to get it in class itself. 
The value was verified with Dr.Bianco and she helped us understand the relevance of the value to reject the null hypothesis. 
Later I just formulated the code and the write based on what I understood.
